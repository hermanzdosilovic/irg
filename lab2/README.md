# Bresenham's line algorithm

In this lab we [implemented](https://github.com/hermanzdosilovic/irg/blob/master/lab2/task.cpp) Bresenham's algorithm with floating-point arithmetics.

Red line represents result of our implementation and black line represents result of build-in `glVertex2i` function.

## Controls

* __Left mouse button click__: choose start/end point of a line

## CLI Output

Outputs _start_ and _end_ point of a line and a angle range of elevation.

```
Line from (381, 99) to (285, 85) [0, 45]
Line from (171, 92) to (114, 183) [-90, -45)
```
